# Basket Mean Reversion via PCA

## Overview
The strategy is developed for a basket of cryptocurrencies which are considered to exhibit similar characteristics and follow common (systematic) trends. It is based on the assumption that any significant deviations from the co-movements of these assets will further lead to their reversion to the common path. Systematic components are constructed through the PCA decomposition, and strategy focuses on the behavior of the remaining part of returns' variance, i.e., residuals. 

The entire strategy is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. Implementation involves data download, market microstructure modelling, backtesting with hyper-optimization and Walk-Forward Analysis, and performance assessment. The data used comes from Cryptocompare, Binance and ByBit, and is mostly downloaded inside the notebooks through a direct connection to websites or API. The following categories of data are used: spot and futures klines in hourly and minute frequency, trade-level data, funding rates data, fees.
